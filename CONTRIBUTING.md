## ✅ Before Opening a Pull Request

Please make sure to:

- [ ] Ensure your changes work as expected
- [ ] Test locally (run the relevant `.sh` or CLI command)
- [ ] Keep changes minimal and focused — one topic per PR is ideal
- [ ] Add or update documentation, if relevant
- [ ] Clearly describe _what_ you changed and _why_

## 🧪 Testing

There’s no fancy test suite here — just run the scripts and make sure they behave as expected.  
If you're introducing new CLI behavior, adding examples to the README is a great way to document and test at the same time.
